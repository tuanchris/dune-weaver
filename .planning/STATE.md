## Completed Milestones

| Version | Name | Completed | Archive |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|
| v1 | Backend Testing | 2026-01-24 | [v1-backend-testing.md](milestones/v1-backend-testing.md) |

## Accumulated Decisions

| Decision | Context | Date |
|----------|---------|------|
| pytest + pytest-asyncio | Test framework selection for async FastAPI testing | 2026-01-24 |
| httpx for API testing | Standard FastAPI testing approach with ASGITransport | 2026-01-24 |
| CI=true env var | Hardware test auto-skip mechanism | 2026-01-24 |
| relative_files = true | Coverage config for CI compatibility | 2026-01-24 |
| Vitest + RTL | Frontend component testing framework | 2026-01-24 |
| Playwright | E2E browser automation | 2026-01-24 |
| MSW | API mocking at network level | 2026-01-24 |
| Extend existing CI | Run frontend tests in same workflow as backend | 2026-01-24 |
| vitest globals | Enable describe/it/expect without imports | 2026-01-24 |
| MSW onUnhandledRequest: warn | Changed from error due to WebSocket conflicts | 2026-01-25 |
| Chromium only (initial) | Faster CI, can add browsers later | 2026-01-24 |
| Observable behavior testing | Focus on what renders, clicks, API calls not implementation | 2026-01-25 |
| apiCallLog for API verification | Track API calls in MSW handlers for integration test assertions | 2026-01-25 |
| Button finding via textContent | More reliable than getByRole for buttons with similar names | 2026-01-25 |
| WebSocket mocking via routeWebSocket | Required to bypass blocking "Connecting to Backend" overlay | 2026-01-25 |
| Dedicated port 5174 for E2E | Avoids conflict with other dev servers on 5173 | 2026-01-25 |

## v3 Milestone Context

**Issues identified during audit:**
1. `onPositionChanged` in main.qml logs every pixel of touch movement
2. Screen timeout timer runs every 1 second continuously
3. Debug console.log statements throughout QML components
4. WebSocket message handler triggers multiple signals per message
5. Pattern preview checks filesystem on every access

**Target:** < 20% CPU when idle on Pi 3B+, Pi 4, Pi 5
